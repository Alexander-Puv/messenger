Messenger is a project made from scratch for one company, in which you can send text, voice messages and images, change profile information (name, photo, etc.) and much more. All this happens in real time thanks to Firebase. The site is not incredibly beautiful and is adapted only for PC, since the main goal is to work with the backend. React, TypeScript, Firebase, Material UI
